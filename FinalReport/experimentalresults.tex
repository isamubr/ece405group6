\section{Testing Frame Construction(FrameObj)}
%Rebecca
% not sure how much of this le will go over...so super brief here
An easy way of being able to integrate with the other teams seemed to be through the creation of a class, FrameObj, which would not only provide the other modules with a means of creating a frame but a list of properties that could be called for easy debugging. There are two ways that an instance of the class FrameObj could be constructed,  from the basic requirements of the frame (Frame type, Sender ID number , Receiver ID number, and Data) or from the bits of data that make up a frame.

4 sections of testing that done to frame object. 

section 1 tests the ways we can make an invalid frame

The test of the implementation of the end to end communication.
Based on proposal of final desing project \cite{cdproj}, there
are six case to be tested in the end to end communication
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Extra-cellular communications between UEs
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item US1 $\rightarrow$ BS1 $\rightarrow$ BS2 $\rightarrow$ US3
    \item US3 $\rightarrow$ BS2 $\rightarrow$ BS1 $\rightarrow$ US1
		\item US2 $\rightarrow$ BS1 $\rightarrow$ BS2 $\rightarrow$ US3
		\item US3 $\rightarrow$ BS2 $\rightarrow$ BS1 $\rightarrow$ US2
  \end{enumerate}
  \item Intra-cellular communications between UEs
	  \begin{enumerate}
    \item US1 $\rightarrow$ BS1 $\rightarrow$ US2
    \item US2 $\rightarrow$ BS1 $\rightarrow$ US1
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
