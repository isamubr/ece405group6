%OLD ABSTRACT
%In this project, we are going to create a simplex control mechanism to coordinate the communications between the nodes. First, we standardize the format of the frames. All the frames transmitted in the system have to be created based on the format. Then, we will utilize CRC-8 to verify the received frame and send the ACK frame if the verification is correct. Finally, we describe the steps and the interfaces with other groups to complete this project.
