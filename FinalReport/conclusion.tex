The main object was to create the end to end communication. It was achieved using a simulation using matlab. However , after the test over the air, changes in the frame object were necessary to make more robust detection of the frame type. Other modification were implemented based on the need of the other teams.So, the frame type helped to make easy to separate the necessary behavior for each group.
The transmission of the frame using two different physical layer was interesting  to see how the performance of the MAC layer is related to the physical one.Moreover, this project taught a lot how to define interface of your code and design make much simpler to integrate with other groups.
