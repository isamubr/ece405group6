The main object of this project was to create the end-to-end communication capabilities of a small cellular network. It was achieved primarily using simulations and code in Matlab. Over the air testing necessitated changes in the frame object to make the detection of the frame type more robust. Other modification were implemented based on the needs of the other teams creating the nework. The frame type helped to make it easy to separate the behavior of the frame for each group.

It was interesting to see the transmission of the frame using two different physical layers. The performance of the MAC layer is related to the physical one. Moreover, this project taught a lot how to define the interface of your code with other teams and how the effective design makes it much simpler to integrate with other groups.
